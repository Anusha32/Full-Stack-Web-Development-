Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that
they are always accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them
from any function, class or file without having to do anything special.

The PHP superglobal variables are:

$GLOBALS
$_SERVER
$_POST
$_GET
$_SESSION and few more.

$_GLOBALS:

$_GLOBALS is a PHP super global variable which is used to access global
variables from anywhere in the PHP script (also from within functions or
methods).
PHP stores all global variables in an array called $GLOBALS[index].
The index holds the name of the variable.
