-----------------------------------------Bootstrap-------------------------------------------

Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. 
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. 
It contains HTML, CSS and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

JS Library :

A JavaScript library is a library of pre-written JavaScript 
that allows for easier development of JavaScript-based
applications, especially for AJAX and other web-centric
technologies
ex: jQuery - js library that simplify the dom manipulation 

JS Framework :

JS frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries
that provide developers with pre-written JS code to use for
routine programming features and tasks-â€”literally a
framework to build websites or web applications around
ex: bootstrap, Angular js, Django


A software framework is not just a library. 
It also includes a particular design architecture which users must work within -
 a sort way in which different items in the library are connected together to provide a generic solution for a particular application type.
Frameworks thus have the advantage of needing only configuration by the user and validation of pre-written tests to become operational. 
With libraries alone users need to design an architecture and create tests before implementation. So more work is needed with just the libraries.
But libs are flexible & potentially more efficient.
