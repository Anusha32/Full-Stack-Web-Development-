------------------------------------ReactJS--------------------------------------- 
React is a library of js used to build interactive UI.
It is not a framework.
React simple, feature rich, 
component based - these are the sub modules present in the web application
UX- is the user experince. 
UI- is the user interface.

Why use React?
	to devleop small and big complex web applications
	Provides solid features to quickly start the development process
	used to develop single page application(SPA)
	no reloading, no navigation to new pages(Youtube)
	web page is divided into various components - can be reused
	react library provides large set of ready made components

What are components?
components are :-
 building blocks of react
 collection of html,css,js
 can be written in pure js or jsx
 jsx- javascript syntax extension
 react can be used to not only build web applications but it can also be used to build desktop apps and mobile apps

ReactJS is all about components

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable
pieces, and think about each piece in isolation

ReactJS application is made up of multiple components,
and each component has its own logic and controls

in react there is only one way data binding.

DOM: 
programming API for HTML and XML doc. 
DOM is a tree like rep. of a web page that gets loaded into the browser.
Using react a local DOM will be created and then only the thing that changes will be updated.
Compute minimal set of changes to apply to the DOM.

Virtual dom:
Virtual dom will be created virtural dom object is a rep. of the original dom object. 
This prevents the reloading of web page the virtual dom will get updated with the original one
Checks the difference btwn the previous dom rep and new dom and the real dom will update only
those parts where changes are applied.


html, css, js- entire code runs on the browser

Node
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, 
back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, 
which was designed to build scalable network applications.



node -v terminal
mkdir name of project
cd name of project

install react js
npx create-react-app appname

cd myapp
npm start


you can reassign  or redefine a variable in var declaration but u cannot do it in let and const
so we use let and const instead of var.

this refers to the instance of the parent class

React components:

Can be created by:
1.Class component
2.Function component
3.component constructor
4.nested components
5.components in files
